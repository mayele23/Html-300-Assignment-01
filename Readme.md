Topic of Choice 
Movie | Entertainment 

I want to build a website that is able to populate a list of movies, tv shows based on a persons feeling of the day or moment. It would be interesting for the user to type a mood and be able to find content in relation to his/her state of mind. \

Why you want to build this?
It will be an interesting project to showcase my creativity, as well as introduce a new way of picking content on the web. A feature to pick content based on mood is available for songs which was introduced by beatsMusic, however with music being 3 to 5 mins users are consitently directed in and out of emotions. A lot of perspective are often projected if we listen to a whole playlist. However movies provide a longer content enough for the viewer to visually engage, understand and feel through reactions and expressions. The future the past is kept and told through movies. A great lesson can be learned from how we should react from the feelings we often go through.
